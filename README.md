# sort_imagesby_color
Sorting images by color tool  
" by philippe and paul c. "
## Usage
go on line 143 and change the folder_path variabile to the folder with images
Also use the changed version of colorhief I added
## Install

```bash
pip install colorthief
pip install pillow
```
## How it works

This script creates a json file with the color data of the photos, also checks if a photo is already in the json and does not add if it already is.  
Uses threading for faster work.
