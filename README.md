" by philippe and paul c. "
## Usage
go on line 143 and change the folder_path variabile to the folder with images

## Install

```bash
pip install colorthief

This script creates a json file with the color data of the photos, also checks if a photo is already in the json and does not add if it already is.  
Uses threading for faster work.
